# Insertion Sort

Welcome to the **Insertion Sort** repository! This Python implementation of Insertion Sort is designed to be simple, educational, and easy to understand—making it perfect for beginners learning about sorting algorithms.

---

## Description

Insertion Sort builds a sorted list one element at a time by comparing each new element with those already sorted and inserting it into the proper position. Although its worst-case time complexity is O(n²), its simplicity and efficiency on small or nearly sorted datasets make it a great learning tool.

---

## Features

- **Simple & Clear:** Easy-to-read code with detailed comments.
- **Educational:** Great for understanding the basics of sorting.
- **Efficient on Small Data:** Works well on small or nearly sorted arrays.
